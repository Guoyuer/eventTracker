# flutter_event_tracker

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

Functionalities:
1. Help users to record various kinds of daily events: 
For every events, the user can choose whether it is with or without ``unit`` and with or without ``duration``,

Thus creating four categories of events. 


For an event with duration, when it starts, a timer is automatically triggered; when it ends, the duration will be recorded. By long pressing the event, the user can manually input a former time as its starting or ending time. Simultaneous running events are allowed ant all events' status will not be disrupted by terminating the app.

For an event without duration, we only care when it is done. A short press adds a record with current time as the timepoint it ends. A long press gives the user a choice to enter a former time. () 


For an event with a unit, when it finishes in any way, the user can attach a value to this time record.
