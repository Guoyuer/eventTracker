## About the Project

### Berief description of the App:

### How to use the app:

#### ``Events`` and ``records``:

An ``event `` is an action or activity in your daily life. 

For every ``event``, the user can choose whether it is with or without ``unit``, and with or without ``duration``, thus creating four categories of events. 

An ``record`` is an occurrence of the corresponding event. Record is inputted by user in the following effective way.

#### some interaction:
For an ``event`` with duration, when it starts, a timer is automatically triggered; when it ends, the user clicked a button and potentially input the value of the bound ``unit``. Then the corresponding ``record`` with its duration and value of ``unit`` will be generated and stored. 

Note: By long pressing the ``event``, the user can manually input a former time as its starting or ending time. Simultaneous-running events are allowed ant all events' status will not be disrupted by terminating the app.

For an event without duration, we only care about its ending time. A short press adds a  ``record`` of it with current time as the end time. To enter a former time as end time, a long press is needed. (Value of unites may be inputted depending on whether the event is bound with a unit).
